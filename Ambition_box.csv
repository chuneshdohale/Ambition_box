One incident can destroy a family’s future and development. We hope no one ever faces such a situation, but the truth is millions of people do. Unlike European countries we have poor social security. The rich can still recover from the financial loss, but the poor cannot recover from such a loss easily. Thus we believe we do a noble act by building awareness about such a product. We are against miss selling. Millions of people every year buy Insurance policies without understanding as they are usually told just a few things to sell the product. Many times these are lies or half-truths; as such commitments are rarely documented or recorded. Thus customers start hating insurance and its sellers hurting persistency and growth. This is no way to build a sustainable business. We believe everyone must fully understand what they are buying, and know both the positives and the negatives. They should know the options, and choose what is best for them and their needs. The true value of any insurance policy lies in the payment of a claim, and we will fight the corner of a customer very hard indeed, at the point of claim, and ensure he gets a fair deal from the insurance company. Finally we believe companies must make a profit too, else how can they continue to service customers. Thus we are against customer side fraud. We like customers to make truthful declarations, and not try to cheat the system. All in all, Insurance has a huge role in supporting families in distress, and we will make it viable for every participant, as we said, fairly, transparently, and sustainably."

Aye Finance,4.2,886,3.3k,38,16,Private,"Delhi,NCT + 208 more",10 years old,1k-5k Employees (India),"Food Processing,Public,Bhopal","The summer that year was unusually hot. When the small team of founder members got together, there was something burning in all of us. All of us had spent long years with some of the finest financial organizations around the world. But we needed something more. We needed something meaningful.

There was a Government of India report that talked about Rs 25 lakh crore credit deficit in MSME industry. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises were 6 crores in number and employed 11 crore people. The micro segment among these was the most disadvantaged when it came to access to formal credit. It was clear to us that India’s growth will not be complete without the advancement of this sector.

By mid-year, we knew what we wanted to do. Indian monsoons were lashing the plains in North India. Dusty plains suddenly became covered with verdant green shoots. Our dream was slowly taking shape – exhilarating just like the petrichor.

Our business plan was far from complete, but our vision was clear – We wanted to be the most admired among finance businesses catering to micro businesses in India. Our core values, that we continue to abide by, followed soon after – Innovation, Trustworthiness, Being the best, Social Good and Customer Commitment.

Thus, Aye was born. Aye means ‘Yes’ in English and ‘Money’ in Hindi. Apt for what we wanted to do – say yes to the aspirations of micro enterprises by providing them with capital.

As we started work, enthusiasm in the team was contagious. We knew we had mountains to move but that did not deter anyone. The initial capital for the company came from friends and angel investors. By end of 2013 we bought an NBFC so that we could start lending. But we had another challenge to surmount. It was not easy to assess the businesses we wanted to lend to. They were neither on credit bureaus nor did have any formal financial documents. Innovation was not an option, but a necessity.

Among the temples of modern India which he designed, was a centre of excellence in the medical sciences. Nehru's dream was that such a centre would set the pace for medical education and research in Southeast Asia , and in this he had the wholehearted support of his Health Minister, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.
The health survey and development committee ,chaired by Sir Joseph Bhore, an Indian Civil Servant ,had in 1946 already recommended the establishment of a national medical centre which would concentrate on meeting the need for highly qualified manpower to look after the nation's expanding health care activities . The dreams of Nehru and Amrit Kaur and the recommendations of the Bhore Committee converged to create a proposal which found favor with the government of New Zealand. A generous grant from New Zealand under the Colombo Plan made it possible to lay the foundation stone of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 1952.The AIIMS was finally created in 1956,as an autonomous institution through an Act of Parliament ,to serve as a nucleus for nurturing excellence in all aspect of health care.
All-India Institute of Medical Sciences was established as an institution of national importance by an Act of Parliament with the objects to develop patterns of teaching in Undergraduate and Post-graduate Medical Education in all its branches so as to demonstrate a high standard of Medical Education in India; to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order for the training of personnel in all important branches of health activity; and to attain self-sufficiency in Post-graduate Medical Education.
The Institute has comprehensive facilities for teaching, research and patient-care. As provided in the Act, AIIMS conducts teaching programs in medical and para-medical courses both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and awards its own degrees. Teaching and research are conducted in 42 disciplines. In the field of medical research AIIMS is the lead, having more than 600 research publications by its faculty and researchers in a year. AIIMS also runs a College of Nursing and trains students for B.Sc.(Hons.) Nursing post-certificate) degrees.
Twenty-five clinical departments including four super specialty centers manage practically all types of disease conditions with support from pre- and Para-clinical departments. However, burn cases, dog-bite cases and patients suffering from infectious diseases are not entertained in the AIIMS Hospital. AIIMS also manages a 60-beded hospital in the Comprehensive Rural Health Centre at Ballabgarh in Haryana and provides health cover to about 2.5 lakh population through the Centre for Community Medicine."

When we saw what was missing in the real estate industry, we created products to bridge the gap. But, when it came to home security, we saw many areas that needed work. That is why we created – NoBrokerHood.

Our founders Akhil Gupta, Amit Kumar Agarwal and Saurabh Garg understood the need to have a tech-enabled visitor and community management system, that aims to make life convenient, hassle-free, and secure for the residents of a gated community.

The constant movement of service staff (maids, drivers, courier services, delivery personnel, etc.) and guests can make security management an inconvenience. While most apartment buildings and residential complexes do have security measures in place, they are either outdated or rely heavily on manual record-keeping – which is time-consuming and sometimes ineffective.

Moreover, in larger societies, there is always doubt on the number of staff required to fulfil day-to-day tasks such as visitor management, accounting and so on. This can pose an issue for residents and other committee members to deal with issues like unauthorised visitor entries/vehicle parking and maintaining service staff attendance. Sometimes, residents are also required to respond to calls from the main gate to authorize entry - which might be troublesome if they are busy at that moment.

This is where NoBrokerHood comes to your rescue. We offer a plethora of services and features which enables our resident community to manage multiple activities from the comfort of their homes – from finding domestic help to monitoring visitor entry and pre-authorising guest visits, it can all be done by phone. We believe that it also further strengthens the security and safety of your society since NoBrokerHood keeps both visual and digital records of all entries and exits – accessible at any time from anywhere – and automates staff entry through a biometric process."

Today, FIITJEE is the most powerful brand in serious education, and this journey from just an IIT-JEE coaching institute, to the most powerful brand, has been exhilarating. However, the journey is not over yet. For us at FIITJEE, the journey will never be over... For us, this journey itself is the destination. The launch of FIITJEE World Schools at Hyderabad is a concentrated effort in that direction, where students will be trained for the best in the world through methodologies and practices that are truly world-class.

India Today, one of the leading magazines of the country conducted a detailed survey on the ranking of coaching centers. As it was the first time, they considered only three major sectors for this year's survey- medical, engineering, and management. This survey has ranked FIITJEE as the number one coaching institute for Engineering Entrance Exam.

Almost a decade on, one thing that has not changed since our humble beginning at a small garage in Byculla, Mumbai, is our passion for adding real value. And that’s what makes us awesome!  

While others were looking to create just “CONTENT”, we placed our bets on “CONTEXT”. We are focused on not just learning but also truly understanding a student’s strengths and weaknesses to improve their learning outcomes and applying knowledge to achieve real-life goals. This philosophy is the cornerstone of our products. (And without a philosophy, a product is just a bunch of mindless features, isn’t it?)

Rooted in consumer behaviour, we are leveraging AI and data science to deliver personalised achievement journeys for every student. Because at Embibe, we believe that no two students learn the same way. And this has led us to embark on this noblest of journeys to deliver life and learning outcomes for every student!

In 2018, Reliance Jio partnered with Embibe to propel our collective vision of democratising education and impacting a billion lives. The Jio-Embibe Partnership has brought unrivalled acceleration to delivering learning outcomes to every corner of India via low-cost devices and high-speed Jio Internet connectivity.

The Embibe Tribe is a dynamic blend of intellectually fierce individuals from various walks of life. Take a stroll around our office (yes, you can visit us anytime) and you will come across alumni from global educational institutions, top academicians, experienced data scientists, pragmatic techies, people from unexpected backgrounds, vagabonds, artists, singers, and even former entrepreneurs! We are diverse but united in our shared vision of democratizing and personalizing education.

We are growing and going places fast. If your heart beats for education and you want to be part of a revolution, you probably have a place here. Hit us up, give us your context and let’s see if we can change the world together!"

Army Public Scho...,4.2,394,1.5k,33,1,Private,"Delhi/NCR,New Delhi + 71 more",49 years old,5k-10k Employees (Global),"Food Processing,Public,Bhopal","It was only when the Indian Army was born in its present form at the dawn of Indian independence that family life really took roots in India’s cantonments. Solders – Officers, Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and men alike were dependent on the existing educational system in the country for education of their wards. As more and more families moved into our cantonments, the existing private schools slowly became unaffordable to soldiers. Even the Central Schools (Kendriya Vidyalaya) did not provide guaranteed admission to the children of soldiers who were frequently transferred from one station to another.

 Realising the importance of children’s education as a major welfare activity, the COAS took a considered decision to establish a chain of schools in various regional commands. This was announced on Army Day – 15 Jan 1980 by the COAS. Thus was born the school system of the Indian Army. By the time, 28 Regimental and 4 High schools had already come up and an umbrella organization was required to co-ordinate the functioning of these schools. To meet the requirement, Army Welfare Education Originisation (AWEO) was created under Adjutant General’s Branch. This organization was registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 on 29 Apr 1983 as Army Welfare Education Society (AWES) being a statutory requirement for affiliation to CBSE. The Apex Body of AWES is the Board of Governors (BOG) with the Chief of Army Staff as the Patron-in-Chief and Army Commanders as Patrons. The day to day work, in pursuance of BOG directions, was to be carried out by an Executive Committee headed by the Adjutant General(AG) and a retired Officer appointed as full time secretary of AWES. This secretariat which started functioning under AG’s Branch as CW-9 later metamorphosed into the present day HQ AWES under a retired officer of Major General rank.

 The schools, initially named as Army High schools, were later christened as Army Schools. All schools were redesignated as Army Public Schools on 01 Jul 2011. There are 137 Army Public Schools across cantonments and military stations in India, all following NCERT curriculum and affiliated to CBSE, New Delhi. The schools are administered by local formation commanders through School Administration and Management Committees (SAMC). From a modest 20000 students population in 1987, APSs have grown to a mammoth systems with a students strength of approximately 2.3 lac and 8500 teaching staff. On an average 5000 students are added every year."

As The Energy of India, IndianOil accounts for nearly half of India's petroleum products market share, with sales of about 90 million tonnes in 2018-19. Over 32% national refining capacity and 71% downstream sector pipelines throughput capacity are with IndianOil. What's more, the IndianOil Group owns and operates 11 of India's 23 refineries, with a combined refining capacity of 80.7 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA). IndianOil refineries are on the last leg of upgradations to produce world-class BS-VI compliant automotive fuels for supplies across the country from 1st April, 2020.

IndianOil's 14,200-km cross-country pipelines network facilitates the transportation of crude oil to refineries and finished products to high-demand centres in an efficient, economical and environment-friendly manner. Its throughput capacity of 94.20 MMTPA for crude oil and petroleum products and 21.69 MMSCMD for gas makes it one of the largest pipeline networks in the world.

As the commercial enterprise with the largest customer interface in India, IndianOil reaches precious petroleum fuels to every nook and corner of the country through its network of over 50,000 customer touch-points, surmounting the challenges of tough terrain, climate and accessibility. This includes 27,700+ fuel stations (petrol pumps), including over 8,000 Kisan Seva Kendra (KSK) outlets in rural markets, all of them fully automated for quality & quantity assurance.

For the convenience of large-volume consumers like the defence services, railways, state transport undertakings, industrial, agricultural and marine sectors, IndianOil has about 7,000 dedicated fuel pumps in operation at their doorstep to ensure timely delivery of products and efficient maintenance of inventory.

For IndianOil, all customers, bulk or retail, are equal and have the right to quality products and efficient services. With this belief, the IndianOil team reaches Indane LPG cooking gas right up to the doorsteps of 14.8 crore households through a network of about 12,000 distributors. The Corporation is promoting LPG aggressively as a clean cooking fuel across socio-economic divides.

IndianOil's Aviation Service commands a 60% market share in aviation fuel, serving national and international flag carriers, private airlines and the Indian defence services with equal efficiency.

The countrywide marketing network is backed for supplies by 125 bulk storage terminals and depots and 91 LPG bottling plants, besides 116 aviation fuel stations and 13 lube blending plants.

As the 'company of choice' for millions of customers from diverse segments, IndianOil has also built up a portfolio of leading energy brands, including Indane LPG cooking gas, SERVO lubricants, XTRAPREMIUM petrol, XTRAMILE diesel, PROPEL petrochemicals, etc. Besides the corporate brand, both SERVO and Indane are over 50 year old brands and have earned the coveted Superbrand status.

IndianOil's sprawling R&D Centre at Faridabad, one of Asia's finest in downstream petroleum R&D, offers competitive advantage to the Corporation through world-class technology and process solutions and innovative products. With four decades of pioneering work in lubricants formulation, refinery processes and pipeline transportation, the Centre has garnered about 800 patents, of which nearly 550 are international patents.

The vibrant research undertaken in tribology is showcased by IndianOil's SERVO productline comprising more than 4,000 lubricant & grease formulations and 850 active grades to suit virtually every application. In addition, the Centre has also developed several refinery process technologies and catalysts specially suited to Indian conditions. The Centre's forte also includes alternative energy programmes in bio-energy, solar energy, Hydrogen energy, H-CNG blends, synthetic fuels and shale oil. It is also focussing on cutting-edge research in nanotechnology, petrochemicals & polymers, coal gasification/liquefaction, and gas-to-liquid technologies. The Centre is also nurturing an eco-system conducive for innovations in the domestic hydrocarbons sector through a Startup Fund.

Over the past decade, IndianOil has assiduously built its new businesses, that is, petrochemicals and natural gas marketing, to a level where they have achieved integration with the core verticals. The Corporation's upstream forays into Exploration & production have also yielded significant results in the form of a sizeable portfolio of oil & gas assets in India and abroad.

Besides being the second largest player in the domestic petrochemicals market, with 3.15 MMTPA capacity, IndianOil exports to over 70 countries, offering the complete slate of petrochemical products and intermediates under the brand name PROPEL. The Corporation has set up world-scale petrochemical plants at Gujarat, Panipat and Paradip refineries over the last two decades with a capex of over Rs. 25,000 crore, and has firm plans to invest Rs. 26,000 crore more till the year 2023-24 to consolidate business, expand capacities and enter niche grades. These projects include revamp/augmentation of existing capacities and new projects, forward integration plans into plastics and textiles parks as well as equity investment in Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Ltd. (HURL) for production of fertilizer.

As the second largest player in India in natural gas, IndianOil is aggressively promoting this eco-friendly fuel among all user segments: industry-transport-homes-commercial establishments. The Corporation aspires for leadership in the R-LNG segment, and is investing/enhancing share in LNG sourcing, import terminals, cross-country gas pipelines, city gas distribution (CGD) networks and bulk supplies by road-tankers. With an ambitious agenda of covering 40 Geographical Areas (GA) on its own as well as with reputed joint venture partners, IndianOil's investment on development of CGD networks, to offer piped natural gas (PNG) to households and compressed natural gas (CNG) as auto-fuel, in the next eight years is likely to be about Rs. 10,000 crore.

Upstream integration into E&P defines IndianOil's vision to bolster its energy security by way of strategic investments in oil equity across the globe. The Corporation's current upstream portfolio by way of Participating Interest comprises 10 domestic E&P assets and 12 overseas assets in 10 countries. With an upstream integration ratio of 5.5% and a balanced portfolio of producing, discovered and exploration assets, the Corporation has achieved significant progress in terms of 2P reserves, production volumes, equity oil and revenues.

IndianOil has planned for Rs. 2 lakh crore (US$ 29 billion) investments in the next 5-7 years: Besides focus on refinery expansions, new technologies for clean fuels & enhanced outputs, and refinery-petrochemicals integration, IndianOil is aggressively leveraging its R&D expertise to move into horizon technologies like 2G & 3G ethanol, bio-fuels, coal gasification, H-CNG, Hydrogen fuel cells, battery technologies, etc. These technologies, along with cleaner fuels and higher engine efficiencies, can offer sustainable solutions to today's energy challenges."

The Cooper family has been in Satara for more than a 100 years now and has established its name in many diverse fields, ranging from agriculture, education, social reform, politics to liquor, engineering, and other industries.

Its name is associated with many luminaries like Chatrapati Bhonsale Scions, Yashwantrao Chavan, Prabhodhankar Thackeray, Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, Dr Ambedkar, Veer Savarkar, Walchand, Kirloskar, Kalyani, great reformer Keshavrao Vichare and Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur.

Sir Dhanjisha B Cooper, the first entrepreneur in the family, came from a very humble background. His father was a carpenter in charge of repairing barrels at a distillery and hence, the family name, Cooper.

However, D B Cooper broke free from the family profession and started a liquor business by extracting toddy from palm trees in a plantation that he maintained. Simultaneously, he ran many liquor shops throughout the former state of Bombay Presidency.

Being an entrepreneur, he utilised his profits in starting a small company on Satara Road that manufactured ploughs, agriculture equipment, and years later, diesel engines. Eventually, the company went on to be known as Cooper Engineering Limited.

In those days of the British Rule, it was difficult for an Indian to establish an industry anywhere in the country. However, Cooper was one of the three - others being Kirloskar and Ogale - who chose to set up their own factories along the railway line.

Over the years, Cooper Engineering continued to grow under the joint ownership with the Walchand's into a multi-faceted engineering company making diesel engines, machine tools, looms etc.

Back then, Sir D. B. Cooper was also ably assisted by his only son, Nariman D. Cooper, who despite being an agriculture graduate, took to looking after the daily operations of Cooper Engineering."

Tube Investments...,4.2,244,1.6k,12,18,Public,Chennai + 30 more,64 years old,1k-5k Employees (India),"Food Processing,Public,Bhopal","The Group traces its origins to 1898, when Dewan Bahadur A M Murugappa Chettiar went as an apprentice to Burma (now Myanmar). Quick to learn financial skills and Burmese, he realized he was destined to greater achievements; he founded a firm in Moulmein, a large port-city in Lower Burma. This grew into a prosperous family-owned business, with interests in Banking, Rubber and Trade, covering Malaya (Malaysia), Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Indonesia and Vietnam. The outbreak of the World War II and subsequent political upheavals in the region cut short the firm’s growth. While a good portion of its hard earned fortunes were lost, the family had the foresight to move significant assets to India; this financial prudence ensured that the business would rebound after the disaster. And rebound it did.

Back home in India, the Group had engaged in businesses like Rubber, Steel cabinets, Yarn and other traded goods. But the real major industrial opportunity came soon after Independence. Political Independence spawned Economic Independence: and AMM Murugappa Chettiar, Dewan Bahadur’s eldest son (and by then, head of the family) was quick to realise it. His vision was to start a business that would manufacture a product for the common man which they could sell in large numbers. Thus, in 1949, TI Cycles of India (TICI) was born in collaboration with TI of UK. It was the Group’s first of many successful Joint Ventures and also its first foray into large scale manufacturing. Later, as a measure of backward integration two more companies were formed: Tube Products of India (TPI) in 1955, to make steel tubes for bicycle frames and TI Diamond Chain (TIDC) in 1960 to make bicycle chains. Over a period of time these two businesses have moved up the value chain from bicycle parts to higher technology products.

In 1959, Tube Investments of India (TII) was formed by merging TI Cycles of India and Tube Products of India. TI Diamond Chain was merged with the parent company, in 2004. In 1962, the company saw a potential to leverage its engineering skills to address the market for roll formed metal products. So a new unit called TI Metal Forming was created to realize this potential; to this day it is recognized as the pioneer in this business."

Seth and Mrs. Chand Seth has brought immense popularity to Tops all over India, and in as many as 25 countries around the world. Changing lifestyles support demand for convenience foods. A simple statement, but as we steadily march on the path towards development, it holds so true. The trend towards smaller households, higher women participation in the workforce, and also an increasing number of bachelors and one-parent households, are contributing to an erosion of traditional patterns of eating. Food companies are coming up with new products that require little time but still evoke the aura of home cooking.

Therefore, the trend towards the sale of complete meals to be consumed at home is becoming increasingly evident, meeting consumer demands for convenience.

Luckily for us, agricultural production and food processing account for 30 percent of India's GDP and employ more than 70 per cent of its workforce. India is the second largest producer of fruits in the world after Brazil. In vegetables, India's production is exceeded only by that of China.

The swanky and modern Metro system introduced comfortable, air conditioned and eco-friendly services for the first time in India and completely revolutionized the mass transportation scenario not only in the National Capital Region but the entire country. Having constructed a massive network of about 389 Km with 285 stations (including NOIDA-Greater NOIDA Corridor and Rapid Metro, Gurugram) in record time in Delhi, NCR, the DMRC today stands out as a shining example of how a mammoth technically complex infrastructure project can be completed before time and within budgeted cost by a Government agency. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) was registered on 3rdMay 1995 under the Companies Act, 1956 with equal equity participation of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) and the Central Government to implement the dream of construction and operation of a world- class Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS). The DMRC opened its first corridor between Shahdara and Tis Hazari on 25thDecember, 2002. Subsequently, the first phase of construction worth 65 kilometres of Metro lines was finished two years and nine months ahead of schedule in 2005. Since then the DMRC has also completed the construction of another 125 kilometres of Metro corridors under the second phase in only four and a half years. Presently, the Delhi Metro network consists of about 389 Km with 285 stations. The network has now crossed the boundaries of Delhi to reach NOIDA and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh and Ballabhgarh in Haryana. With the opening of the Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar and Janakpuri West - Botanical Garden Sections, new age trains equipped with the Unattended Train Operation (UTO) technology have been introduced. These trains operate with the Communication Based Train Control(CBTC) signaling technology which facilitate movement of trains in very short frequencies. This network also includes the NOIDA - Greater NOIDA Aqua Line. The Aqua Line has been constructed by DMRC on behalf of the NOIDA Metro Rail Corporation and is also being operated by DMRC currently. In addition, the 11.6 kilometre long Rapid Metro also connects with the Delhi Metro network at Sikanderpur station of Yellow Line. The Rapid Metro provides connectivity within the satellite city of Gurugram. The Airport Express link between the Indira Gandhi International Airport and New Delhi has now propelled Delhi to the league of global cities which have high speed rail connectivity between the city and the airport. The DMRC today has over 300 train sets of four, six and eight coaches. The Delhi Metro has also contributed tremendously on the environment front by becoming the first ever railway project in the world to claim carbon credits for regenerative braking. DMRC has also been certified by the United Nations (UN) as the first Metro Rail and Rail based system in the world to get carbon Credits for reducing Green House gas emissions as it has helped to reduce pollution levels in the city by 6.3 lakh tons every year thus helping in reducing global warming."

The company is registered as TATA SIA Airlines Limited.

In 2013, two legendary brands, Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, decided to fulfil a long-cherished shared dream to bring forth a distinguished flying experience to air travellers in India. With its strong historical ties with aviation, the Tata group had long wished to re-enter the aviation sector, after Tata Airlines was renamed Air India and eventually, nationalised. Both, the Tata group and Singapore Airlines were also firm believers in the growth potential of the Indian aviation sector and hence tried to enter the market in the past; first, in 1994 by setting up a joint venture to start an airline in India and then in 2000, teaming up to purchase stakes in Air India. However, after the lifting of foreign investment restrictions in 2012, the partners once again sought approval for a tie-up, which it obtained in October 2013. On November 5, 2013, Vistara’s holding company, TATA SIA Airlines Limited, was incorporated.

The common goal of the joint venture is to redefine air travel in India to provide Indian travellers a seamless and personalized flying experience that blends Tata’s and SIA’s service excellence and legendary hospitality. The brand name ‘Vistara’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Vistaar’ that means ‘a limitless expanse’. The name Vistara draws inspiration from the world that Vistara inhabits, viz. the ‘limitless’ sky. The brand also draws stimulus from the image that passengers most associate with a smooth and enjoyable flight – the endless, blue horizon they see through the windows of an aircraft. As it aims to transform the flying experience of travellers in India, Vistara christens its brand tagline as ‘fly the new feeling’.

On January 9, 2015, Vistara started its operations with a maiden flight from Delhi to Mumbai. In a short span of time, Vistara has rapidly expanded its footprint, both in terms of network and service proposition. Vistara now serves 33 destinations with over 200 flights daily operated by a fleet of 26 Airbus A320 and 9 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. Vistara has already flown more than 15 million happy customers since starting operations"

It is with this rich experience in digital education that Tata ClassEdge was conceptualized in 2011 with the aim of improving the effectiveness of education systems in India.

Being a research-based organization, we spoke to academicians, influential stakeholders as well as parents and students to identify the challenges in Indian school education. We realized that there were primarily four issues Engaging varied learners in the classroom, lack of personalization in education, Administrative burden of teachers and principals, low parent involvement

While technology solution providers could potentially ease some of these problems, from our experience of 25 years, we have realized that technology alone can never be a solution. Tata ClassEdge believes that teachers are central to the teaching-learning experiences in a classroom and that the role of technology is to empower them, not to make them passive or redundant. Success, therefore, lies in thoughtful pedagogical design and meticulous implementation of technology.

That’s when Tata ClassEdge decided to be a partner to schools in the journey of schooling and help schools apply technology in a way that addresses their specific needs. Thanks to Tata ClassEdge Cosmos, an ecosystem of solutions we’ve developed over the past 5 years, we now have an integrated approach to deal with the various aspects of schooling."
